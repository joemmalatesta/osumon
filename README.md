## Speed Comparison
[!speed comparison](/Side%20by%20Side.mp4)
This app was intentionally made to have three different speeds caused by real errors that real developers make. The root URL will randomly redirect to `v1` `v2` or `v3` where you can expect page load performance to decrease from ~2 seconds at v1 all the way up to 8 at v3 (where I'm making all my requests in series ü§Æ)

## Blog
I wrote a blog for Sentry using this app as an example of how to find and resolve performance issues more quickly with the Trace View ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Hope you enjoy :D
